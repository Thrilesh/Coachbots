**Note Storage Platform API**
This is a RESTful API for a Note Storage Platform that allows users to store notes, including textual, audio, and video content. Users can create, retrieve, and query notes based on various criteria. 
The API is implemented using Flask and utilizes SQLite for data storage.

**Installation**
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

**Database Setup**
The API uses SQLite as the database system. The database file is named notes.db.
To create the necessary database tables, run the create_tables() function in the code. This can be done by executing the following command: python mainapp.py.

**Usage**
Start the Flask development server: python mainapp.py.
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
Use a REST client or tools like cURL or Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

**API Endpoints**
POST /notes - Create a new note.
GET /notes/<note_id> - Get a note by ID.
GET /notes?user_id=<user_id> - Query notes based on user ID.
Please refer to the code for detailed information on the request/response formats and available endpoints.

**Development**
Ensure that you have Python and Flask installed on your system.
The code is structured in a modular way. Additional functionality can be added by extending the existing codebase.
Use proper error handling and validation to enhance the robustness of the API.

**Deployment**
This API is intended for development and testing purposes. For production deployment, it is recommended to use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
